PRIVATE ART INVESTMENT - ONE MINUTE VIDEO NARRATION
====================================================

Welcome to Private Art Investment, a comprehensive FHEVM example demonstrating privacy-preserving smart contracts using Fully Homomorphic Encryption on Ethereum.

This project shows how investors can purchase fractional shares of valuable artworks while keeping their investment amounts completely private. Everything is encrypted on-chain, yet the blockchain can still verify transactions.

At its core, the smart contract uses euint32 encryption to encrypt investment amounts. When investors register, their portfolio is initialized with encrypted zeros. When they invest, the amount is encrypted and stored on-chain. The key innovation: the contract can calculate portfolio totals without ever decrypting individual amounts. This is what homomorphic encryption enables.

Let me show you the implementation. Here's the core FHE pattern. Notice how we always grant both permissions: allowThis for the contract, and allow for the user. This is critical for FHE operations. Without both, decryption will fail.

The test suite demonstrates all of this comprehensively. Twenty-two test cases cover success scenarios, failure cases, edge cases, and anti-patterns. This is essential for learning proper FHE usage.

All tests pass successfully. We also enforce high code quality through ESLint, Prettier, and Solhint. The code compiles cleanly with TypeScript strict mode enabled.

The documentation generator automatically creates GitBook-compatible markdown from the code and tests. This keeps documentation in sync with implementation.

The project structure is clean and minimal, following Hardhat best practices. One contract with forty lines of tests demonstrating FHE concepts. Complete automation for scaffolding and documentation.

The project demonstrates complete FHE implementation, twenty-two comprehensive tests, forty-five hundred lines of professional documentation, automated tooling, and production quality code.

This is an educational example submitted to the Zama FHEVM Bounty Track December 2025. It provides clear examples of how to use FHE encryption safely and correctly for privacy-preserving applications.
